# Join us for the launch of the co-creation process on December 12

The December 12 launch event will explore opportunities to develop new data and technology tools within the four focus areas of the national Civic Innovation Challenge:

1. Equity & Access
2. Resilience
3. Mobility
4. Built Environment

As an outcome of the launch event, we expect to generate a prioritized list of data, technology, and behavior change use cases within each of these focus areas.
